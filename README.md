# School_District_Analysis by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the School District Analysis
student funding and student test scores, aggregate data and show trends in performance to report to the school board. The analysis group
The school board has notified us that the initial analysis showed evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. I have been asked asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. I would have to re-run the school district analysis.
