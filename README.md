# School_District_Analysis by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the School District Analysis
In the initial analyis, I utilized Anaconda's Jupyter notebook feature, along with the Pandas library, to analyze school funding and student test scores in a particular district. The data was aggregated and summarized in various Dataframes that showed trends in test performance and budget spent per student, across different factors like school size and grade. This was reported to the school board to assist in their decision making.

The school board determined that the initial analysis showed evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. In the Challenge, I was asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. I re-ran the school district analysis, and was tasked with determining differences between the initial analysis and the Challenge

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Anaconda 4.10.1, Pandas Library, kernels PythonData and numpy; Jupyter Notebook
- Reference:
  - Initial Analysis Code: PyCitySchools.ipynb
  - Challenge Code: PYCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

## Summary 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
