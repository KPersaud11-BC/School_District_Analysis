# School_District_Analysis by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The school board has notified us that the initial analysis showed evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. I have been asked asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. I would have to re-run the school district analysis.
